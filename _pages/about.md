Hello,

It's great to see you here! I'm Pankaj Pradeep, I'm a recent Master's student in Biomedical Engineering student at Columbia University in the City of New York, where I have pursued research to hone my Bioinformatics skills to contribute to research pipelines. During my time at Columbia, I worked with varying types of biological data to derive insights using Machine Learning and Computational Biology techniques. I am passionate about contributing to groundbreaking research in the field of cancer therapeutics and bioinformatics. Through my coursework and research experiences at Columbia, I aim to gain expertise in computational biology, oncology research, and hands-on skills for handling diverse genomics data, including single-cell data and different omics data, to better prepare myself to support the development of therapies for cancer and other life-threatening diseases.


At my Undergraduate at VIT, I engaged in Molecular Biology, DNA and RNA extraction, Protein Engineering, and Design, Cell and Microbiology Cultures, and upskilled myself to make a significant contribution to the industry. I also participated in clubs and societies such as Alpha Bio Cell and SABEST which gave me the platform to explore my management and leadership skills along with learning from industry experts through the workshops and events I organized.

During my free time, I engage in sports activities like soccer, table tennis, and tennis. I also enthusiastically read about upcoming trends in the Biomedical, Biotechnology, and Automobile Industries.
