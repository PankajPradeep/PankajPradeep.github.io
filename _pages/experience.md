# Internships
<br>

## Student Research Worker

_Sep '23 — Dec '23_
<br>
**Gertrude H. Sergivesky Centre, Columbia Irving Medical Centre, New York, NY**
<br>
I have been working under the guidance of Dr. Giuseppe Tosto since September 2023. My current work primarily focuses on pre-processing 2500 FASTQ files for Bioinformatics Analysis, with the aim of studying Alzheimer Disease. This work involves the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease risk factors in underrepresented populations, utilizing tools such as R and Unix. Additionally, I am investigating whole-genome sequenced and GWAS data to identify genetic composition-based differences among populations and their corresponding risks. To further enhance my research, I perform deconvolution of RNAseq data to single cells using CIBERSORTx.

## Computational Biology Oncology Intern

_Jun '23 — Aug '23_
<br>
**GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (GSK), Collegeville, PA**
<br>
As part of my summer internship at GSK, I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of bioinformatics and cancer research. During this valuable experience, I conducted an in-depth exploration of clinical signatures related to cancer gene and protein expression, using data from various public databases. My work was centered on systematically evaluating the correlation patterns between RNA expression and proteomics in 947 cancer cell lines, drawing from esteemed resources like the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Python served as my tool of choice for data analysis. To enhance the interpretability of my findings, I effectively visualized correlation distributions and compared them using Earth Mover’s Distance, making complex data more accessible. Additionally, I was responsible for ingesting and processing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) cancer datasets sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) into Bioinformatics pipelines. This multifaceted approach to cancer research was a rewarding and intellectually stimulating part of my summer internship at GSK.

## Student Researcher

_Oct '22 — June '23_
<br>
**Herbert and Florence Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics, Columbia University, New York, NY**
<br>
I also had the privilege of delving into cutting-edge research focused on the role of extrachromosomal DNA in cancer evolution. Leveraging AmpliconArchitect, I employed a combination of UNIX and RStudio to explore this intriguing field. My work involved the comprehensive analysis of 80 samples to uncover the presence and significance of extrachromosomal DNA. Using tools such as bedtools, bwa, and SAMtools, I meticulously dissected the genetic landscape, contributing to a deeper understanding of this critical aspect of cancer genetics. In addition, I played an integral role in setting up packages for analyzing gene data specific to esophageal cancer. One of the highlights of my internship was the discovery of novel DNA regions through Integrated Genome Viewer and the UCSC Browser for visualization, which were identified as extrachromosomal DNA hits. This collaborative endeavor was carried out in partnership with esteemed professionals, including Professor Karol Nowicki-Osuch and a PhD student. 

## Biotech Research Intern

_Sep '21 — June '22_
<br>
**Technoculture Research, Bihar, India**
<br>
During my internship at Technoculture Research, I focused on conducting research and proposing ideas for a Point of Care (POC) device capable of detecting DNA-related disorders. This project involved exploring various aspects of DNA detection and analysis, including the evaluation of different fluorophores for sensitive DNA and PCR amplicon detection. I delved into fluorescent-based target detection, with a particular emphasis on DNA as the target of interest. Additionally, I researched the utility of molecular beacons for DNA-based target detection and investigated the conjugation of fluorophores with molecular beacons to enhance DNA detection accuracy and sensitivity. I also had the opportunity to propose and design a device or setup for the efficient detection of nucleic acids, including DNA, in a point-of-care setting. This project provided me with invaluable experience in the field of molecular biology, diagnostics, and biotechnology.

## Scientific Research Intern

_Jul '21 — Sep '21_
<br>
**Organismic Technologies, SuSPoT, Bengaluru, India**
<br>
During my internship at Organismic Technologies, a government-funded start-up, I had the unique opportunity to engage in research related to the production of somaclones of Turmeric and Ginger variants through direct organogenesis. This project involved various aspects of plant tissue culture and laboratory operations. I played a crucial role in maintaining greenhouse operations, ensuring the growth and health of plant specimens. I conducted plant tissue culture techniques to obtain somaclones of the variants of the Turmeric and Ginger species, contributing to the study of genetic variations and breeding. I gained hands-on experience in operating laboratory equipment for plant tissue culture, including working in a Laminar Air Flow environment, preparing media, and conducting literature reviews to stay updated on the latest advancements in plant biotechnology. This internship not only broadened my understanding of plant biology but also provided a hands-on introduction to the fascinating world of tissue culture and genetic modification.

## Data Analyst and Research Intern

_Jun '20 — Nov '20_
<br>
**IonCure Tech Pvt. Ltd, Delhi, India**
<br>
During my internship at IonCure Tech Pvt. Ltd, I undertook a data analysis and research project that centered on studying beef consumption in Rhode Island, USA, with a focus on food supply chains and dietary habits. I conducted web-scraping to gather comprehensive information related to beef consumption, production, import, and sales within the state of Rhode Island. Applying a wide range of data science tools and techniques, I analyzed the gathered data systematically, aiming to provide a detailed research article that could offer insights into dietary patterns and supply chain dynamics. I had the privilege of being the sole author of the resulting research article, which employed time-step analysis and data science methodologies to uncover trends and patterns in beef consumption. This project not only honed my data analysis skills but also allowed me to explore the interdisciplinary nature of data science in the context of the food and supply chain industry.
