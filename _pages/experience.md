## Security Consulting Engineer

_Jan '20 — Jun '20_

**Cisco Systems Inc, Bengaluru, India**
<br>
I work as a Security Consulting Engineer under Cisco's Customer Experience - Security (Professional Services). As a consulting engineer, I specialize in securing large-scale enterprise-grade networks using advanced network security technologies that include intrusion prevention systems, firewalls, email and web security appliances, cloud-based DNS security solutions, endpoint security systems, network access control systems and policy administration servers.

I've implemented these solutions using a plethora of Cisco's security products including Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance, Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Next-Generation Firewall, and Cisco Identity Services Engine.

I've done multiple research and innovation projects around these products and helped bring automation to ease customer delivery and increase workforce productivity. The technologies involved in these projects include software development on Flask and Django web frameworks, python, shell scripting and SQL database.
