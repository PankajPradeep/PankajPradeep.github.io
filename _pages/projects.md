# Research Projects

## Insights into Phenylketonuria and Suggested Solution to Disorder

_Jan '21 — Jun '21_
<br>
**Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India**
<br>
During this project, I performed a comprehensive literature review to gain a profound understanding of Phenylketonuria (PKU) and the severity of this genetic disorder. I meticulously analyzed the mutations at the genetic level to identify which mutation(s) had the most disruptive or damaging impact on PKU patients. In addition to this, I proposed a novel solution to address PKU and conducted feasibility studies to assess the practicality and effectiveness of this solution. This project not only deepened my knowledge of genetic disorders but also allowed me to explore potential solutions to alleviate the challenges faced by PKU patients.

## In-Silico Analysis of PTEN Variants causing Breast Cancer (Aug 2020 – Feb 2021)

_Aug '20 — Feb '21_
<br>
**Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India**
<br>
This project involved a meticulous analysis of PTEN variants associated with breast cancer. I identified the amino acid changes that were most harmful to the PTEN protein structure and subsequently evaluated the stability of each amino acid change using specialized software tools. Additionally, using PyMol I compared the structural variations between mutated protein structures and the native protein structure when these mutations were induced. To gather relevant genetic information, I utilized databases such as the dbSNP database, Polyphen-2 database server, and SIFT for SNP collection and analysis. This project significantly enhanced my understanding of the genetic factors contributing to breast cancer.

## Vitamin B12: The Energy Vitamin - A Review Paper

_Aug '20 — Jan '21_
<br>
**Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India**
<br>
In this project, I documented a comparative study after conducting an in-depth review of approximately 70 research papers. My focus was on optimizing strategies to enhance the yield of vitamin B12 during industrial production. This project not only contributed to the body of knowledge surrounding vitamin B12 but also explored practical applications for industrial optimization. We drafted an extensive review paper that was submitted to multiple journals for review with a tabular column comparing all the information ever known for producing Vitamin B12 industrially.

## Checking the Effectiveness of Commercially Available Sanitizers on Microbes

_Jan '19 — May '19_
<br>
**Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India**
<br>
As part of my Microbiology course, I investigated the effectiveness of commercially available sanitizers on microbes by collecting swab samples from various sources. I then executed microbiological laboratory techniques, including Spread Plating and Agar-Well Diffusion Methods, to assess the efficiency of these sanitizers. After comprehensive analysis and experimentation, I compiled a final report presenting the findings, which indicated that the sanitizers achieved an efficacy rate of approximately 96-97%. This project provided insights into the real-world application of sanitizers and their impact on microbial communities.
